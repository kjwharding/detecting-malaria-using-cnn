# Application Examples
In this part of the technical documentation, there are example screenshots of how the application works on a computer with a 16:9 screen. There are small details present in the application that can be found when observant. For instance, the favicon logo or the small logos pattern scattered across the application backing. Please find a step-by-step example of how the application works below.
